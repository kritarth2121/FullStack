JavaScript is used mainly for enhancing the interaction of a user with the webpage. In other words, you can make your webpage more lively and interactive, with the help of JavaScript. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile application development.
        JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, which appeared in Netscape, a popular browser of that time.The language was initially called LiveScript and was later renamed JavaScript. There are many programmers who think that JavaScript and Java are the same. In fact, JavaScript and Java are very much unrelated. Java is a very complex programming language whereas JavaScript is only a scripting language. The syntax of JavaScript is mostly influenced by the programming language C.
